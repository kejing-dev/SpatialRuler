/**
 * The pre-built panel pool. Every attachment panel of the app is declared once, with a fixed size,
 * and gets a holder entity here. A panel appears by enabling its holder and moving it into place and
 * disappears by disabling the holder and taking it out of the room: nothing is created at that moment
 * (at the emulator's idle frame rate a new panel takes seconds to show up, and a resized one shows
 * stale rows).
 *
 * 1 dp of an attachment panel is 0.8 mm at scale 1 (measured in the feasibility spike).
 *
 * How a panel is hidden follows from three findings on the emulator (SDK 6.1.9):
 * 1. A panel entity that is parented under a disabled holder never appears, also not after the holder
 *    is enabled. A slot therefore stays enabled until its panel has been parented and has had a few
 *    frames to come up; until then a hidden slot is parked (out of the view, a thousandth of its size).
 * 2. A panel must not stay parked. While a parked panel hangs below a head anchor, no panel on the
 *    line of sight through that anchor gets the pointer: a pinch goes through them to whatever lies
 *    behind (seen for the body panel with the parked menu panels below the same anchor, and for a
 *    test panel in front of the parked snackbar panel's anchor, from 0.26 m to 1.2 m along the ray).
 *    With the holder disabled instead, the same panels get their presses. So a hidden slot is disabled
 *    as soon as finding 1 allows.
 * 3. What a panel draws while it is parked stays broken (black, a few rows only) when it is shown.
 *    A panel therefore draws its content after it was shown: [onVisibility] tells the Compose side,
 *    which composes a panel's content only then. "After" means after the engine has rendered the panel
 *    in its place: the report follows [SHOW_FRAMES] engine frames later. Reported in the same frame, the
 *    content was sometimes drawn first when the emulator idled at a few frames per second (Compose draws
 *    within 16 ms, the engine's next frame came half a second later), and the snackbar came up black.
 *
 * 4. A panel takes the pointer over its whole rectangle, also where it draws nothing: a pinch on the
 *    empty part of a panel is not delivered to anything, neither to the panel's content nor to the
 *    pin or surface behind it (seen with reading plates, whose pill is narrower than their panel).
 *    A panel whose content is narrower than the panel is therefore made exactly as wide as its content:
 *    the holder is squeezed along its width ([Slot.widthFactor]) and the content is drawn stretched by
 *    the inverse, so that the picture is unchanged and no empty part is left.
 *
 * Rule that follows, and that [violations] checks: **a slot that is not shown never lies on a line of
 * sight.** Hidden = holder disabled *and* stowed: a room panel behind the viewer ([stowBehind]), a
 * panel that hangs on the head or on the instrument body 40 m below it in the head's own frame.
 * Parked (finding 1, for the first frames only) = the same places, enabled.
 *
 * Facing. A panel in the room turns towards the viewer about the vertical and then pitches towards
 * the viewer, at most 60 degrees, without roll. The turn is written to the holder here, once per frame
 * ([faceViewer]), and not left to a `LookAtComponent`: with that component the panel is drawn turned,
 * but the pointer still hits it where it would be without the turn (presses on a tag 20 degrees off
 * axis landed up to 59 px beside the aimed point and matched the unturned plane to the pixel). With
 * the rotation in the holder's own transform, picture and pointer agree.
